add `render` prop to `NavigationItem`

- the `render` prop enables the substitution of the default anchor tag with an alternate link, such as React Router, facilitating integration with routing libraries.
- parent items can now be modified to act as hyperlinks to specific pages while still retaining the ability to expand and collapse rows
